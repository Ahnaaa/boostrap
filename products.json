In staying true to its 1950s origins, our update retains the unique cutouts and spaces, with details such as a rubber-wrapped foot rest and solid wood drawer guides pulled directly from Frattini's found photograph. Satin black powdercoated legs and a champagne brass crossbar beautifully complement the natural beauty of the wood, which is certified sustainable by the Forest Stewardship Council ®. The desktop and shelves are made with richly grained walnut, with a black ebonized oak drawer that pulls out for dramatic contrast. Originally designed for an architect to accommodate rolls of drafting paper, the desk is well-suited for all modern professional pursuits. CB2 exclusive."
